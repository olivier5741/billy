# Install and use

* Make a copy (you need a google account) of the following sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-e_bFuhDniOCnR9-pmYMlhpSFKaDhrhSskj6pAtWrPU.
* Open the copied spreadsheet (best to move it to a specific folder since it might create additionnal folders and files to handle archiving and printing of the invoices)
* Create an invoice through the menu `Facturation > Créer une facture > avec pièces`
* The first time it will ask you to confirm you trust the app (under `advanced ...`), **do it only if you trust the developer** (me).
  * Redo the action creating an invoice after you trusted the app (the action was discontinued)
* Enter some data in `M.O.` and `Détails fournitures` down the page.
* Archive the invoice through the menu `Facturation > Archiver la facture`
* The invoice will be in Drive, under the folder `Archives`
